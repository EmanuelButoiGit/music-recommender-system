# user-prediciton

I built a music recommender based on age and gender. 
With the help of "decision tree" algorithm I can predict the music that people love.

# Steps:
# 1. Import the Data
# 2. Clean the Data
# 3. Split data into Training/Test Sets
# 4. Create a Model
# 5. Train the Model
# 6. Make Predictions
# 7. Evaluate and Improve

I used Jupyter Notebook (anaconda3) and Python to create this project.
For saving and loading models I used joblib.
